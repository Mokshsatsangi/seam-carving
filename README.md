# Seam Carving

Seam carving (or liquid rescaling) is an algorithm for content-aware image resizing, developed by Shai Avidan, of Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL), and Ariel Shamir, of the Interdisciplinary Center and MERL. It functions by establishing a number of seams (paths of least energy) in an image and automatically removes seams to reduce image size or inserts seams to extend it.


# Example

Remove vertical seams from this image to reduce the distance between the girl and the cliff ends.
